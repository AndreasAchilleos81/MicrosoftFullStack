Documenting for later usage how co-pilot helped me create this minimal api

Scafolding was build easily and in a matter of seconds
After scafolding I could add more interesting User properties with minimal changes to the api endpoins
Co-pilot also helped me build fast my requests.http file



My code was working just fine but co-pilot pointed out I was not returning my Results.Ok and Results.NotFound
for my Put method
It also pointed out some spelling mistakes for consistency
And it also pointed out that I could validate my incoming objects.
It suggested that I wrap some code it try catch blocks so I created a globla middelware to catch all exceptions
