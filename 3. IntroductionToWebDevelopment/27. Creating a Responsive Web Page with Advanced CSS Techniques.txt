Creating a Responsive Web Page with Advanced CSS Techniques
# Responsive Design Fundamentals Lab

This lab will focus on **responsive design fundamentals**, ensuring your page adapts well to different screen sizes while maintaining **accessibility** and **aesthetic appeal**.

## Setting Up the HTML Structure

Before applying any CSS, we need to set up the **structure** of our HTML document. This will act as the framework holding all the content. We'll create a basic web page structure with a **header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer**.

Using **semantic HTML tags** like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` enhances both **accessibility** and **SEO**.

### Example HTML Structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Responsive Design Lab</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <a href="#">Home</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
        <a href="#">Contact</a>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <h2>Main Content</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph inside the main content section.</p>
        <aside>
            <h3>Sidebar</h3>
            <p>This is some additional information.</p>
        </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Applying CSS for Styling & Layout

Now that we have a structured HTML document, we will apply **CSS styles** to define how elements are displayed.

### Box Model and General Styles

The **box model** is critical in CSS as it determines the **size, padding, borders, and margins** of elements. By applying the `box-sizing: border-box;` property, we ensure that the padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height.

```css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### Styling the Header and Navigation Bar

```css
header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: #444;
    padding: 10px;
}

nav a {
    color: white;
    margin: 0 15px;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

Note: While .navbar a refers to any \<a> that is a child element inside a container element. Hyperlinks that are not children of .navbar elements will not be affected.&#x20;



### Styling the Footer

```css
footer {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

## Making the Page Responsive with Media Queries

A **responsive web page** adjusts based on the screen size it's viewed on. We'll use **media queries** to apply different styles based on the screen size.

### Example Media Query for Small Screens

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    main {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    aside {
        width: 100%;
    }
    nav {
        flex-direction: column;
        text-align: center;
    }
}
```

## Adding CSS Transitions and Animations

CSS **transitions** and **animations** help make your webpage more **interactive** and **engaging**.

### Transition Example (Navigation Links)

```css
nav a {
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

nav a:hover {
    color: yellow;
}
```

### Animation Example (Header Movement)

```css
@keyframes slide {
    0% { transform: translateX(0); }
    100% { transform: translateX(10px); }
}

header {
    animation: slide 2s infinite alternate;
}
```

## Running the Code

After writing the HTML and CSS, **select the button at the top right to run the code**. If this were live, you'd see:

- A **responsive layout** where content adjusts to screen size.
- **Navigation links** smoothly changing color when hovered.
- The **header slightly moving** in a loop for a dynamic effect.
