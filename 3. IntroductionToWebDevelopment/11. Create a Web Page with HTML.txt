Create a Web Page with HTML

Creating a Web Page: Step-by-Step Guide
1️⃣ Setting Up the Basic Structure

Before adding content, we need to set up the foundation of our web page—just like building a house before furnishing it.
🔹 Add the DOCTYPE Declaration

At the top of the document, we declare HTML5:

<!DOCTYPE html>

🔹 Define the Character Set

To ensure proper text encoding, we include the meta charset attribute:

<meta charset="UTF-8">

🔹 Add a Page Title

We define the title of the web page inside the <title> tag:

<title>My Web Page</title>

🔹 Create the Body Section

Everything visible on the page goes inside the <body> tag:

<body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
</body>

✅ Now, click the Run Code button to see how it renders!
2️⃣ Adding Text & Lists
🔹 Insert a Subheading

We add a level 2 heading (<h2>) to introduce content:

<h2>Welcome to My Web Page</h2>

🔹 Add a Paragraph

A paragraph (<p>) is used for text content:

<p>This is a sample paragraph explaining the purpose of the web page.</p>

🔹 Create an Unordered List (Bulleted List)

We use <ul> for an unordered list and <li> for list items:

<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ul>

🔹 Create an Ordered List (Numbered List)

For step-by-step instructions, we use <ol>:

<ol>
    <li>Step one</li>
    <li>Step two</li>
    <li>Step three</li>
</ol>

🔹 Add a Call-to-Action Link

We use an <a> tag to create a hyperlink:

<p>Click <a href="https://example.com">here</a> to learn more!</p>

✅ Click the Run Code button again to check our progress. We should now see:
✔ A title
✔ A subheading
✔ A paragraph
✔ Two lists (unordered and ordered)
✔ A hyperlink
3️⃣ Embedding Media (Images, Videos, and Audio)
🔹 Insert an Image

We use the <img> tag with a source (src) and alternative text (alt):

<img src="image.jpg" alt="A descriptive image">

🔹 Embed a Video

We add a <video> tag with a source (src) and controls:

<video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

🔹 Add an Audio File

We include an <audio> tag with controls:

<audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

✅ Click the Run Code button once more, and you should now see:
✔ An image
✔ A video
✔ An audio file
