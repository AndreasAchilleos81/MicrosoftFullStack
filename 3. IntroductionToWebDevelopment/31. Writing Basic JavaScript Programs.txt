Writing Basic JavaScript Programs

JavaScript Lab

Introduction

At the end of this lab, you'll know how to create an HTML file that includes JavaScript. You'll learn how to:

Declare variables using let, const, and var.

Use if statements and loops to control the flow of your code.

Write simple JavaScript functions that work inside your web pages.

Creating a Basic HTML Document with JavaScript

Let's start by creating a basic HTML document and embedding some JavaScript into it.

Steps:

Define the document type for HTML5.

Specify the language for the document (English).

Set the character encoding for the document.

Set the viewport for responsive web design.

Set the title of the document to JavaScript Lab.

Add the heading Hello JavaScript inside the body.

Insert a JavaScript statement to log a message.

Code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Lab</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello JavaScript</h1>
    <script>
        console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Declaring Variables

JavaScript allows you to declare variables using let, const, and var:

let is used when the variable's value can change.

const is used for variables that should not change once they are set.

var is an older way of declaring variables and should generally be avoided in modern JavaScript.

Steps:

Declare the variable name as "Alice".

Declare the constant age as 30.

Declare the variable city as "New York".

Print the values to the console.

Code:

<script>
    let name = "Alice";
    const age = 30;
    let city = "New York";
    
    console.log(name);
    console.log(age);
    console.log(city);
</script>

Using If Statements

Control structures allow you to dictate the flow of your program. An if statement checks whether a condition is true or false and executes the corresponding code.

Steps:

Declare a variable number and assign it the value 10.

Write a condition to check if number is greater than 5.

Display a message in the console if the condition is true.

Code:

<script>
    let number = 10;
    if (number > 5) {
        console.log("The number is greater than 5");
    }
</script>

Using Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The most common loop in JavaScript is the for loop.

Steps:

Initialize the loop with i = 1.

Set the condition i <= 5.

Print the value of i inside the loop.

Code:

<script>
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
</script>

Writing Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate blocks of code and reuse them throughout your program.

Steps:

Declare a function that takes a number as a parameter.

Return the square of the parameter.

Print the result to the console.

Code:

<script>
    function square(number) {
        return number * number;
    }
    console.log(square(4)); // Output: 16
</script>
