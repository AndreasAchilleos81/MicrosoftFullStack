Introduction to GitHub

🌐 What is GitHub?

GitHub is an essential platform for developers working together on projects. It provides powerful tools that streamline:

    Code collaboration

    Version control

    Project management

By centralizing code, tracking issues, and organizing workflows, GitHub helps teams stay productive and organized, especially in distributed environments.
🎯 Why Use GitHub?

GitHub is built on Git, the version control system, but adds a web-based layer for:

    Code hosting

    Project collaboration

    Team coordination

It's become a central hub for teams managing software projects—whether they’re in the same room or across the world.
🎬 Key Features of GitHub for Collaborative Development

Let's explore GitHub's core collaboration tools and how they support smooth team workflows.
📁 Repositories (repo)

A repository is the home base for your project’s code and files. It’s where everything lives and where team members access or contribute to the codebase.

Common actions:

    Create a new repository when starting a project

    Clone a repo locally for development:

    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Repositories support version control and collaboration, making it easier to track every change.
🔄 Pull Requests

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository’s code.

After making changes in a branch, you create a pull request to submit your updates for review:

    Team members review the code

    Feedback and suggestions are provided

    Once approved, the PR is merged into the main branch

This ensures code quality and team consensus before updates go live.
🐞 Issues

Issues are like your project's to-do list. They’re used to:

    Track bugs

    Request new features

    Manage development tasks

Example workflow:

    A user reports a bug by creating an issue

    It’s assigned to a developer

    The issue is tracked through to resolution

# Example Issue Template
- Bug: Unexpected layout shift on mobile
- Steps to reproduce: ...
- Assigned to: @devname

Issues help prioritize work and keep projects on track.
🗂️ Projects (Project Boards)

Project boards are visual tools for managing and organizing work.

    Organize tasks into columns like: To Do, In Progress, Done

    Track progress during sprints

    Assign cards (tasks/issues) to team members

This Kanban-style approach gives a clear overview of the current status and workload.
