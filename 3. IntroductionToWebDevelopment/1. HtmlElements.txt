HTML Elements:

Document notes:

HTML tag: have opening tags and closing tags

Some tags do not use closing tags such as <br> OR <br/> to be compatible with XHTML tag - line break tag
they are know as self closing tags as well

<h1> <h1> Heading 1

<p> paragraph content </p>

<div> content in here  </div> - used to create divisions or sections helps organize content

Basic HTML document structure:
Start with the doctype tag no closing needed its just to tell the browser HTML follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
// in here we include metadata like the title that appears on the browser tab
// links to scripts 
// links to css style sheets
// nothing here gets rendered in the broswer page
</head>

<body>
// all the other objects that will be rendered in the browser
</body>

A simple template would look like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
	<head>
		<title>My Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
		<p>This is a paragraph on my webpage.</p>
	</body>
</html>





Every webpage you visit, from news sites to online stores, is built using HTML. 
This fundamental language shapes the structure of content, making it readable and organized on the web. 
HTML is the first step in creating a successful online presence. 
In this video, we will explain the fundamental components of HTML, focusing on elements and tags. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create webpages. 
Think of HTML as the skeleton of your webpage, giving it structure and organization. 
Every webpage starts with a basic HTML document that includes tags to define its elements. 
Now a tag is a special code enclosed in angle brackets used to mark the start and end of HTML elements and tell the browser how to display content. 
Tags come in pairs, an opening tag, like &lt;h1&gt;, and a closing tag, like &lt;/h1&gt;. 
Some elements use self-closing tags, like &lt;br /&gt; which don't need a separate closing tag. 
An HTML element is made up of a start tag, content, and an end tag. 
Elements define the structure and content of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and sections. 
Let's explore some common HTML elements. The &lt;h1&gt; element is used for headings. 
It includes a start tag, &lt;h1&gt;, content (the heading text), and the end tag, which is &lt;/h1&gt;. 
This makes the bold and large stand out. For example, GroovyCo's homepage uses &lt;h1&gt; for the main title to make it clear and prominent. 
The &lt;p&gt; element is used for paragraphs. It includes a start tag of &lt;p&gt;, content, the paragraph text, and an end tag, which is &lt;/p&gt; 
This groups sentences into readable blocks of text. The &lt;div&gt; element is used for creating divisions or sections on a webpage. 
It includes a start tag, &lt;div&gt; , any content inside it, and an end tag, &lt;/div&gt;. 
This helps organize different parts of the content. 
An interesting fact is that some HTML elements don't require an end tag. 
These are called self-closing tags. 
Self-closing tags is a type of HTML tag that doesn't need an end tag. 
It is used for elements that do not contain any content. 
For example, the &lt;br /&gt; tag is used to insert a line break and doesn't need a separate closing tag. 
Now that we understand the different types of tags, let's see how they fit together to form the structure of an HTML document. 
The basic structure of an HTML document includes the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration and the main &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements. 
Inside these, various elements and tags work together to form the content of the webpage. 
Let's take a look at the basic structure of an HTML document. 
Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document is essential for creating webpages. 
Here is a simple template. The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines the document type as a version of HTML. 
It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document. 
The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of the page, containing all other elements. 
The &lt;head&gt; section contains the metadata, like the title, link to style sheets, or scripts. 
It doesn't display content on the page. 
The &lt;title&gt; element defines the title of the webpage, shown in the browser tab. 
The &lt;body&gt; element contains all the content that's displayed on the webpage, such as text, images, and links. 
Knowing how to use HTML elements and tags is essential for building webpages. 
These basics are the foundation for all web content. Happy coding!
