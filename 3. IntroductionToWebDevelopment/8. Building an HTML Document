Building an HTML Document

Before we start adding content to an HTML document, we need to set up the basic structure. HTML documents have a very specific format that helps browsers understand how to display the content. Let's go through the HTML document structure in six parts, step by step.
Step 1: Set Up the Basic Structure

    Line 1: Add the declaration that specifies the HTML document type.

    Line 4: Add the attribute to set the character encoding for the document.

    Line 5: Add the title tag to define the title that will appear in the browser tab.

    Line 7: Add the tag that wraps the visible content of the web page.

Now that we have our basic skeleton, let's add some content to the body of the document.
Step 2: Add Text Content

One of the most common tasks in HTML is adding text. Let's add headings, paragraphs, and basic elements to the body of our HTML document:

    Line 1: Add the opening tag for the main heading.

    Line 2: Add the opening tag for the subheading.

    Line 3: Add the closing tag for the first paragraph.

    Line 5: Add the opening tag for the first paragraph.

    Line 7: Add the closing tag for the third heading.

Step 3: Add Lists

Lists are a great way to organize information in HTML. There are two types of lists:

    Unordered Lists (bullet points)

    Ordered Lists (numbered)

Each item in a list is defined using the <li> tag.

    Unordered List:

        Add the opening tag for the first list item.

        Add the closing tag for the second list item.

        Add the opening tag for the third list item.

    Ordered List:

        Add the opening tag for the first list item.

        Add the opening tag for the second list item.

        Add the opening tag for the third list item.

Step 4: Add Tables

Tables in HTML are used to present data in a structured format.

    Define the table using the <table> tag.

    Rows are created with the <tr> tag.

    Table headers use the <th> tag, and regular data cells use the <td> tag.

    To make your tables more organized, use the <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> tags.

    Always use the scope attribute on headers for accessibility.

Steps for creating a table:

    Add the table caption.

    Add the table headers with scope to improve accessibility.

    Add table data cells for the first and second rows.

    Add the footer cell with colspan="3" to span all columns.

Step 5: Add a Form

Forms are the primary way websites collect information from users. To create a basic form:

    Use the <form> tag.

    Include input fields like text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.

    Use the <label> tag for accessibility, helping screen readers interpret the form.

Steps for creating the form:

    Define the for attribute for the name label.

    Set the input type for the name field.

    Define the id and name attributes for the name input field.

    Repeat for the email field, subscription radio button, newsletter checkbox, and submit button.

Step 6: Embed Media

In modern web design, multimedia elements like images, videos, and audio files are common. HTML provides special tags to embed these media types:

    Images: Use the <img> tag, including the alt attribute for accessibility.

    Videos: Use the <video> tag, including the controls attribute for playback controls.

    Audio: Use the <audio> tag, also with controls for user interaction.

Steps for embedding media:

    Add the <img> tag and define the src (source) and alt (alternative text) attributes.

    Add the <video> tag with the controls attribute, and define the src and type attributes for the video.

    Add the <audio> tag, specifying the src and type for the audio file.
