# Azure CLI Commands Reference

## Overview
This document contains Azure CLI commands extracted from the tutorial for deploying a Blazor web application to Azure.

---

## 1. Login to Azure

### Command
```bash
az login
```

### Description
Logs you into your Azure account. This command opens a web browser where you can enter your Azure credentials. After successful authentication, it retrieves all your subscriptions from the Azure service.

### Example
```bash
az login
```

**What it does:**
- Opens a web browser for authentication
- Retrieves all available Azure subscriptions
- Sets a default subscription for subsequent commands

## 2. Create Resource Group

### Command
```bash
az group create --name <resource-group-name> --location <location>
```

### Description
Creates a new resource group in Azure. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The location parameter determines the Azure region where the resource group metadata will be stored.

### Example
```bash
az group create --name test-resource-group --location eastus
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a resource group named "test-resource-group"
- Sets the location to East US
- Returns provisioning status and resource group information

**Important Notes:**
- The location depends on where you're located as a developer
- Some locations may not have all services available
- Research which location is best for your needs
- East US is a safe choice with all services available

## 3. Create App Service Plan

### Command
```bash
az appservice plan create --name <plan-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --sku <sku-tier>
```

### Description
Creates an App Service plan that defines the compute resources for your web app. The plan sets configurations like CPU speed, memory allocation, and pricing tier.

### Example
```bash
az appservice plan create --name test-service-plan --resource-group test-resource-group --sku F1
```

**What it does:**
- Creates an App Service plan named "test-service-plan"
- Associates it with the "test-resource-group" resource group
- Uses the F1 SKU (Free tier)
- Returns detailed information about the service plan configuration

**SKU Options:**
- **F1**: Free tier (suitable for testing)
- Higher tiers available for production applications with more traffic and faster response times

**Important Notes:**
- Research different plans, features, and costs before choosing
- Free version is good for testing
- Production apps should use higher tier plans

## 4. Create Web App

### Command
```bash
az webapp create --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --plan <plan-name>
```

### Description
Creates a web app in Azure. This sets up a basic web app container with all necessary settings that Azure needs to run your application on Azure's servers.

### Example
```bash
az webapp create --name azure-web-app-595 --resource-group test-resource-group --plan test-service-plan
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a web app with the specified name
- Associates it with the resource group
- Links it to the App Service plan
- Returns comprehensive details including IP addresses, location, and worker information

**Important Notes:**
- The web app name must be globally unique across Azure
- The name appears in the URL (e.g., `https://azure-web-app-595.azurewebsites.net`)
- Generic names like "test-web-app" are often already taken
- If a name exists, you'll receive an error and need to choose a different name

## 5. Deploy Application to Web App

### Command
```bash
az webapp up --name <app-name>
```

### Description
Deploys a local application to an existing Azure web app. This command packages and uploads your application from the current directory to the specified Azure web app.

### Example
```bash
az webapp up --name azure-web-app-595
```

**What it does:**
- Deploys the local application in the current directory
- Pushes content to the specified Azure web app
- Updates runtime version automatically (e.g., to .NET 6)
- Waits for runtime propagation
- Provides deployment status and progress information

**Important Notes:**
- Run this command from your application's root directory
- The CLI will detect and configure the appropriate runtime
- Shows detailed deployment progress in the terminal

## Benefits of Using Azure CLI

- **Automation**: Write scripts to automate deployment processes
- **Batch Operations**: Deploy multiple apps at once
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with build pipelines
- **No GUI Required**: All operations can be done from the command line
- **Scripting**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Version Control**: Store deployment scripts in source control

---

## Typical Deployment Workflow

1. **Login**: `az login`
2. **Create Resource Group**: `az group create --name <name> --location <location>`
3. **Create App Service Plan**: `az appservice plan create --name <name> --resource-group <rg> --sku <sku>`
4. **Create Web App**: `az webapp create --name <name> --resource-group <rg> --plan <plan>`
5. **Deploy Application**: `az webapp up --name <name>`

## Additional Information

All Azure CLI commands return detailed JSON output containing:
- Resource IDs
- IP addresses
- Location information
- Number of workers
- Runtime versions
- Provisioning status
- And much more

This JSON data can be:
- Saved for future reference
- Stored for personal use
- Parsed by scripts for automation
- Used in CI/CD pipelines
