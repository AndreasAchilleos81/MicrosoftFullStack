This guide demonstrates how to use the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) within a development environment like Visual Studio Code to monitor security, check regulatory compliance, and remediate vulnerabilities.

## 1. Environment Setup

To perform security audits from your terminal, you must first install the Azure CLI and authenticate your session.

* **Tool:** Visual Studio Code Terminal or PowerShell.
* **Authentication Command:** `az login`

## 2. Running Security Assessments

Azure allows you to generate a list of all resources that need to be evaluated based on security measures.

### Fetching Assessment Data

Run the following command to see the security status of your subscription:
`az security assessment list`

* **Status Indicators:** The command returns a JSON object for each resource. It identifies if an asset is **"Healthy"** or **"Unhealthy"**.
* **Example:** You might find an entry stating *"Microsoft Defender for Servers should be enabled."* The JSON output provides the reasoning and specific feedback on how to improve the security of that asset.

## 3. Managing Security Tasks

You can generate a structured task list to identify specific misconfigurations that need fixing.

### Example: Identifying Web App Vulnerabilities

Running a task list command might reveal specific policy violations:

* **Issue:** Application is accessible via HTTP.
* **Required Action:** Enable **HTTPS Only**.
* **Severity Rating:** These tasks are assigned ratings (e.g., **Medium**), allowing you to prioritize your workflow.

## 4. Monitoring Regulatory Compliance

For organizations in regulated industries (Healthcare, Finance, etc.), Azure tracks adherence to global frameworks.

### Checking Compliance Standards

The following command lists assets and their conformance to standards like **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, or **ISO**:
`az security regulatory-compliance-standard list`

* **Function:** It identifies exactly where your applications are "out of compliance," allowing you to generate reports for auditors or internal stakeholders.

## 5. Remediating Issues via CLI

One of the most powerful features of the Azure CLI is the ability to fix security holes immediately without opening the Azure Portal.

### Example: Enabling Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

If an audit reveals that a SQL database is unencrypted, you can fix it with a single command:

```bash
az sql db update \
  --name <database-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --server <server-name> \
  --transparent-data-encryption Enabled

```

## 6. Automation and Best Practices

Security shouldn't be a one-time event. Because these tools export data in **JSON**, you can:

* **Create Dashboards:** Pipe the data into visualization tools.
* **Automate Audits:** Write scripts to run these assessments daily.
* **Auto-Remediation:** Trigger scripts that automatically fix common issues (like disabling public access) as soon as they are detected.
