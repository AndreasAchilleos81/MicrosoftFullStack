Step 3:

Design outline:
	Modules required: 
		AddStudent module
		AddSubject module
		ViewStudentsRecords module
		Main module where menu and options will guide user to use above modules
		
	Coding components:
	
		A Class for subject
			Variables:
				Name - name of subject
				Grade - the grade the student has received this subject
			Methods:
				ToString() - string representation of a Subject
				
				
		A Class for Student:
			Variables: 
				AverageGrade
				Name
				ID
				List of Subjects a student has attended and received a grade for
			Methods:
				CalculateAverageGrade() - calculate average grade from all subject grades
				ShowAverageGrade() - calculate and show average grade
				AddSubject(string subjectName, decimal grade) - add a subject the student has studied and has a grade for
				ToString() to print out the student and their courses with their grades and average grade.
			
		
		A Class for StudentGradeManager - that will handle subjects and students
			Variables:
				List of Students
					List of subjects per student variable
			Methods:
				AddStudent()
				AddSubject()
				ViewStudentsRecords()
			
			switch statements:
				To handle the user's input in regards to the menu options they are presented
			
			if/else statements:
				Check on add Subject module if students exist and provide message if so
				Check on View students module if students exist and provide message if so
			Loops:
				The main menu should be in a while true loop to keep repeating the user their menu options
				The ViewStudentsRecords module should loop through all students and through all the courses per student
