# Load Balancing in Scalable Systems

## Introduction

Imagine an online store hosting a flash sale, with thousands of users flooding the website simultaneously. Despite the surge in traffic, the site remains responsive, fast, and reliable. No crashes. No delays. How does the system handle these demands? The key is load balancing. By spreading traffic across multiple servers, it prevents overload and ensures systems stay responsive and reliable.

In this video, we'll identify the role and purpose of load balancing in scalable systems. Let's begin by exploring load balancing concepts, starting with what a load balancer is.

## What is a Load Balancer?

A load balancer is a system that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed. Imagine you're at a grocery store with multiple checkout lanes. The store manager directs you to the shortest line to keep things moving quickly. That's how a load balancer works, redirecting requests to the least busy server to prevent delays or crashes.

Load balancing uses rules called algorithms to distribute traffic efficiently, and one commonly used algorithm is the round-robin algorithm.

## Round-Robin Algorithm

The round-robin algorithm is a method that cycles through available servers to distribute requests evenly. Because of this, it helps to prevent bottlenecks, maximizing resource utilization, and therefore maintain consistent performance across the system, making it an effective strategy for balancing workloads in scalable applications.

To further illustrate, let's imagine a teacher handing out assignments to students one at a time, moving down each row of students until each one has an assignment. A round-robin algorithm distributes requests in a similar way, ensuring each server gets its share of the workload.

## Health Checks

Another load balancing concept is the use of health checks. Health checks ensure to make sure servers maintain reliable performance. Health checks are regular tests to ensure servers are functional and able to handle traffic.

If a server fails during a health check, traffic is redirected to the other servers. Think about a chef confirming their kitchen staff is ready before service begins. If someone isn't prepared, the chef relocates the tasks to the others. Health checks work similarly by testing servers regularly and redirecting traffic if one becomes unavailable.

## Sticky Sessions

Load balancing can also ensure a consistent user experience by keeping users connected to the same server throughout their visit, a process known as sticky sessions. Sticky sessions ensure that a user stays connected to the same server throughout their session.

Sticky sessions help maintain context and continuity, like preserving shopping cart items or user preferences, without requiring the server to repeatedly retrieve data from a shared database or cache. They are especially useful when stateful interactions or personalized experiences are critical to user satisfaction.

For example, imagine dining at a restaurant and throughout your meal, the same waiter takes care of your table. This person remembers your drink, orders, and preferences during your visit, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience. Sticky sessions work the same way. They keep a user connected to the same backend during their session, ensuring their shopping cart or preferences remain intact without needing repeated data retrieval.

## Real-World Scenario

Now let's explore how these concepts work together in a real-world scenario. Imagine an e-commerce website experiencing a huge traffic spike during a product launch.

The load balancer comes into action using a round-robin algorithm to distribute the request evenly across multiple servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed. At the same time, health checks monitor the server to ensure that they're functional. If the server goes down, the load balancer quickly redirects traffic to a healthy server. Sticky sessions keep customers connected to the same server throughout their entire checkout process, preserving their shopping carts and ensuring a seamless experience.

Together, these strategies ensure the website remains fast and reliable during peak traffic.

## Summary

In this video, you learned about the role and purpose of load balancing in scalable systems. By understanding and implementing these load balancing concepts, you'll be able to work to prevent delays and crashes, even in high-traffic systems.
