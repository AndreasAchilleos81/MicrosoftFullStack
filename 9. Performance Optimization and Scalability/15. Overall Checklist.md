Best Practices for Query Writing
Avoid SELECT * – Retrieve only necessary columns to minimize resource usage.

Use WHERE clauses efficiently – Filter data early to avoid full table scans.

Limit subqueries – Use joins or temporary tables instead of nested subqueries.

Optimize joins – Use appropriate join types and indexes to improve query execution.

Use pagination – Implement LIMIT and OFFSET to handle large datasets.

Indexing Strategies
Create indexes on frequently searched columns – Use CREATE INDEX on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses.

Use covering indexes – Ensure all required columns are included in an index to minimize lookups.

Monitor and adjust indexes – Add, remove, or modify indexes based on query performance and changing workloads.

Query Monitoring & Optimization
Monitor query performance – Use SQL Profiler or Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) to track execution times.

Analyze query workloads – Identify high-impact queries that consume the most CPU or memory.

Adjust indexing dynamically – Optimize indexes based on evolving query patterns.

Set up alerts for slow queries – Configure alerts to detect and respond to inefficient queries in real time.
