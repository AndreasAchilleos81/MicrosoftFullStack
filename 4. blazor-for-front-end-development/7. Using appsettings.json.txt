üîß Managing Environment Configurations with appsettings.json in Blazor

Managing different configurations for environments like Development, Staging, and Production is essential in modern application development. In this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to use the appsettings.json file in a Blazor application to centralize and manage these settings.
üìÑ What Is appsettings.json?

The appsettings.json file is a JSON configuration file in .NET used to store key-value pairs for application settings.

For example:

{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Debug",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}

    Logging is a key that contains nested settings.

    AllowedHosts: "*" allows requests from any domain.

This setup enables different configurations per environment without changing your codebase.
üåê Adding Custom Settings (Example: API URL)

Suppose you're building a delivery app and need to store the API URL. Add a new section to your appsettings.json:

{
  "APISettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.myapp.com"
  }
}

This lets you change the API endpoint without modifying your code.
üß© Accessing Settings in Blazor Using IConfiguration

To use settings from appsettings.json in your code, leverage the built-in IConfiguration interface.
Step 1: Create a Service

Create a folder named Services in your project, and inside it, create a file named ApiService.cs.

using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class ApiService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public ApiService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public string GetBaseUrl()
    {
        return _configuration["APISettings:BaseUrl"];
    }
}

    The IConfiguration object gives access to both appsettings.json and environment-specific files like appsettings.Development.json.

üß∑ Registering the Service

To use the service across your application, register it in Program.cs.
Step 2: Open Program.cs

Find the section where services are registered, and add:

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ApiService>();

This makes the ApiService available via dependency injection in your Blazor components.
üí° Using the Service in a Component

Now you can inject and use your service:

@inject ApiService ApiService

<p>Base URL: @ApiService.GetBaseUrl()</p>

This retrieves the base API URL stored in appsettings.json.
üèó Environment-Specific Configuration

.NET automatically loads:

    appsettings.json (common settings)

    appsettings.Development.json (overrides for development)

    appsettings.Production.json (overrides for production)

You can store different API URLs per environment:

appsettings.Development.json

{
  "APISettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://dev.api.myapp.com"
  }
}

appsettings.Production.json

{
  "APISettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.myapp.com"
  }
}

‚úÖ Why Use appsettings.json?

    Centralizes settings

    Simplifies environment management

    Keeps sensitive URLs and config values out of code

    Supports automatic loading and overrides

üì∫ Final Thoughts

In this walkthrough, you learned how to:

    Define configuration values in appsettings.json

    Access them using IConfiguration

    Register and use a service in Blazor to retrieve settings

    Manage settings per environment

Now it‚Äôs your turn to apply this pattern in your own Blazor or .NET applications.

Creating a Blazor Project
Introduction
This guide will help you set up a Blazor WebAssembly project in Visual Studio Code. You‚Äôll learn how to create the project, configure essential settings, manage dependencies, and use appsettings.json for flexible configuration. These steps provide a solid foundation for building Blazor applications with custom settings and external dependencies.

Steps
Step 1: Create a New Blazor Project
Open Visual Studio Code and launch the terminal.

Type the following command to create a new Blazor WebAssembly project:

dotnet new blazorwasm -o MyFirstBlazorApp

     3.    Press Enter. This command creates a new Blazor app in a folder named "MyFirstBlazorApp."

Step 2: Open and Edit the .csproj File
Locate the .csproj file in the project‚Äôs root directory (inside the "MyFirstBlazorApp" folder).

Open the file in Visual Studio Code. This file controls build settings and dependencies for your Blazor project.

To change the target framework:

Find the <TargetFramework> element within <PropertyGroup> and update its value, for example:

<TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>

     4.    To set the output type and root namespace:

Add the following lines in the <PropertyGroup> section:

<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>

<RootNamespace>MyBlazorApp</RootNamespace>

Step 3: Add Dependencies
Inside the .csproj file, locate or add an <ItemGroup> section.

To add a NuGet package:

Add a <PackageReference> entry for each package you need. For example, to add Newtonsoft.Json, use:

<ItemGroup>

  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />

</ItemGroup>

     3.    Save the file to allow Visual Studio Code to download and include the new package in your project.

Step 4: Use appsettings.json for Application Settings
Check if an appsettings.json file exists in your project root. If not, create one.

Open appsettings.json and add key-value pairs for your configuration. For example, to add an API base URL:

{

  "ApiSettings": {

    "BaseUrl": "https://api.myapp.com"

  }

}

     3.    Save the file. This file stores settings outside of the code, making updates easier.

Step 5: Access Settings in Code
Create a Service Class:

In your project, create a folder named Services.

Inside Services, create a new file named ApiService.cs.

Add the following code to ApiService.cs to retrieve settings from appsettings.json:

using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class ApiService

{

    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

 		   public ApiService(IConfiguration configuration)

    {

        _configuration = configuration;

    }

    public string GetApiUrl()

    {

        return _configuration["ApiSettings:BaseUrl"];

    }

}

     2.    Register the Service:

Open Program.cs and add your new service to the service container:

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ApiService>();

Conclusion
Following these steps, you have created a Blazor WebAssembly project, configured project settings, managed dependencies, and set up appsettings.json for centralized configuration. This setup is ready for further development and customizations, providing a solid base for your Blazor application‚Äôs needs.
