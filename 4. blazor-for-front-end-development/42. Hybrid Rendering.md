# Hybrid Rendering for Fast and Responsive Web Apps

Building a web app that loads quickly and stays responsive is essential to user engagement. The good news is, you don't have to choose between speed and interactivity. By combining content delivery methods, you can achieve both.

## Rendering Approaches

Before getting into how these approaches are combined, let's first review the two main methods for rendering content.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
In **server-side rendering (SSR)**, the content of a webpage is built on the server and sent to the browser fully prepared. It's like visiting a news site where the entire article is ready to read the moment you click the link. The server has done all the work, so the page loads instantly.

This approach is ideal for sites focused on fast-loading, static content such as articles or images.

Example:
```csharp
@page "/news"
<h1>@Model.Title</h1>
<p>@Model.Content</p>
Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
In client-side rendering (CSR), the browser takes on the task of rendering content. For example, with Blazor WebAssembly, the app runs directly in the browser using C#. This makes it ideal for applications that need frequent updates and high interactivity.

For instance, in an interactive web app, CSR allows content to refresh instantly as users navigate or interact without needing to reload the entire page.

Example:

csharp
@code {
    private string message = "Hello, Blazor!";
}
<h1>@message</h1>

Hybrid Rendering: Best of Both Worlds
Hybrid rendering combines SSR and CSR to improve user experience. It allows part of the webpage to be rendered on the server (SSR) and part on the client (CSR), offering:

Fast initial page loads from SSR

Dynamic interactivity from CSR

Example Use Case: Online Shopping
In an online shopping app:

The main page loads quickly through SSR.

Dynamic updates (e.g., product recommendations or reviews) happen via CSR in real-time, making the experience both fast and interactive.

Benefits of Hybrid Rendering
1. Fast Content Loading
By using SSR to prepare content on the server, pages load instantly.

Example: In a blog, SSR enables the text of a post to load right away, letting readers start immediately without delay.

2. Improved SEO
SSR makes it easier for search engines to index pages and rank them higher.

3. Enhanced Interactivity
CSR allows parts of the page to update instantly without a full reload, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

4. Scalability and Flexibility
Combining SSR and CSR helps developers balance fast loading with dynamic features that adapt to user needs.

Hybrid rendering helps you balance fast loading and interactive features. By combining SSR and CSR, you can build web apps that are both quick and dynamic, giving users the best experience.
