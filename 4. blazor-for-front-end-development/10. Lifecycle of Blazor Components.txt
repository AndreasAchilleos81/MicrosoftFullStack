Lifecycle of Blazor Components
Introduction 
The Blazor component lifecycle is essential for managing component state, rendering, updates, and cleanup in applications, allowing developers to build efficient and dynamic user interfaces. Lifecycle methods are specifically designed to control component behavior across different phases.

Key Lifecycle Methods and Their Purposes
OnInitialized: Called once when the component is initialized. This method is suitable for setting up initial state and loading data that wonâ€™t change frequently.

OnInitializedAsync: An asynchronous version for data fetching at the start of the component lifecycle.

OnParametersSet: Triggered when the component receives new parameters from a parent. It helps update component state based on parameter changes, enabling dynamic behavior.

OnAfterRender: Runs after the component has rendered, ideal for interacting with JavaScript or performing post-render updates. It includes a firstRender flag to limit specific operations to the first render only.

Dispose: Used when a component is no longer needed, this method cleans up resources like timers or event listeners to prevent memory issues.

Best Practices for Effective Lifecycle Method Usage
Keep Methods Simple: Isolate responsibilities within each lifecycle method, such as handling data fetching only in OnInitialized.

Optimize Rendering: Control unnecessary re-renders using ShouldRender, reducing performance overhead by re-rendering only when needed.

Conclusion 
By mastering these lifecycle methods, developers can enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of Blazor applications, ensuring a seamless user experience.
