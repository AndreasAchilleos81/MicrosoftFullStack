Attendance Tracker 


A User Session Tracker for state management:

	User Session Tracker: A feature that records and maintains a user's session state, ensuring continuity across different components and pages within the Blazor app.

	State Management: The ability to track user sessions and their interactions within the app, possibly storing information like login status, preferences, or active selections.

	Persistent State Handling: Ensuring that session data does not get lost when navigating between pages or refreshing the app.

	Events the user has subscribed to or registered for—allowing them to see which events they plan to attend.

	Personalized session details—such as saved preferences or bookmarked events.

	User-specific interactions—like RSVP status, comments, or feedback on events.

	Session continuity—so users don't lose their data when navigating between pages.
	
	Better yet look into this:
		Attendance Tracking – Logs whether a user actually attends an event they've registered for.
		Event Registrations & RSVPs – Tracks which events a user has signed up for or shown interest in.
