Building a Blazor Web Application with Visual Studio Code

Blazor is a powerful framework that allows you to build interactive web applications using C#. It enables you to write both client-side and server-side logic in a single language, streamlining the development process and making your applications easier to maintain.

In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of creating a new Blazor project using Visual Studio Code.
Step 1: Set Up Visual Studio Code

    Open Visual Studio Code.

    In the Extensions panel (on the left sidebar), search for C#.

    Install the C# Dev Kit extension. This extension allows Visual Studio Code to understand and work with C# code, making it easy to write and debug Blazor applications.

Step 2: Verify .NET SDK Installation

Blazor requires the .NET SDK to run. To check if it's installed:

    Open the Terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on Terminal in the top menu and selecting New Terminal.

    In the terminal, type the following command:

    dotnet --version

    This will display the version of the .NET SDK if it's installed. If you get an error or no version number, you will need to install the .NET SDK.

    To install the .NET SDK, visit the official .NET download page. Follow the instructions for your operating system.

The .NET SDK is essential for building and running Blazor projects, so make sure it's installed before proceeding.
Step 3: Create a New Blazor Project

With Visual Studio Code and the .NET SDK set up, you're ready to create a Blazor project. You can choose between Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) based on your app's needs.

    Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

    Type the following command to create a Blazor Server app:

dotnet new blazorserver -o MyBlazorApp

Alternatively, for a Blazor WebAssembly app, type:

    dotnet new blazorwasm -o MyBlazorApp

        Blazor Server: Runs your app on the server and sends updates to the client. Ideal for apps that require real-time data, such as stock market apps.

        Blazor WebAssembly: Runs your app directly in the browser, without needing constant communication with the server. This is a good choice for apps that don't require real-time updates.

For most beginners, Blazor WebAssembly is a great starting point since it runs entirely in the browser.
Step 4: Choose a Template and Set Up Your Project

    After running the command to create your Blazor project, type the following to list all available templates:

dotnet new --list

For this example, we will choose the Blazor WebAssembly template. You can select any template from the list, but for a simple, client-side app, Blazor WebAssembly works well.

Name your project: It's essential to choose a meaningful name for your project to keep it organized. In this example, we will name the project GrooveEcoBlazor.

    dotnet new blazorwasm -o GrooveEcoBlazor

Step 5: Open the Project in Visual Studio Code

    Go to the Welcome page in Visual Studio Code.

    Click on Open and navigate to your project folder (e.g., GrooveEcoBlazor).

    Your project should now appear in the workspace, ready for editing.

Step 6: Run the Blazor Project

To see your Blazor app in action, follow these steps:

    Navigate to your project folder in the terminal:

cd GrooveEcoBlazor

Run the application with the following command:

dotnet run

This command compiles your code and launches the Blazor app. You should see output similar to:

    Now listening on: http://localhost:5000

    Open a web browser and go to the URL displayed (e.g., http://localhost:5000). You will see your Blazor app running locally.

        Localhost refers to your computer acting as the server while you're testing the app.

Step 7: Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created and run a Blazor app. From here, you can begin to expand your application by adding more functionality, such as:

    Dynamic content (e.g., displaying real-time data).

    User authentication and authorization.

    Custom components for interactive UI elements.

Whether you're building a portfolio project, a dynamic web app, or your next big idea, Blazor provides the tools to help you develop interactive, powerful web applications using C#.
Summary

In this guide, you:

    Installed and set up Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit extension.

    Verified the installation of the .NET SDK.

    Created a new Blazor project using either Blazor WebAssembly or Blazor Server.

    Ran the project locally and interacted with it in your browser.

With these steps, you're ready to start building your own Blazor applications and exploring more advanced features.


Initial Setup of the Blazor Project:

Developers often face the challenge of building highly interactive, robust web applications that deliver a seamless experience across platforms. However, achieving this often requires managing multiple languages and frameworks, which can be complex and time-consuming.

This is where Blazor comes in. By allowing developers to build web applications with C# and .NET, Blazor simplifies the development process, making projects more efficient and collaborative while reducing reliance on JavaScript.
What is Blazor?

Blazor is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET. It's a great choice if you want to create robust, full-featured web applications without writing JavaScript.
Preparing the Development Environment

Before we begin creating a Blazor project, ensure your development environment is ready:

    Install Visual Studio Code

    Install the .NET SDK

        Make sure the latest version of each tool is downloaded and installed.

Creating a New Blazor Project

Once the tools are ready:

    Open Visual Studio Code

    Open the integrated terminal:

        From the top menu, select:
        Terminal → New Terminal

    In the terminal, run the following command to create a new Blazor WebAssembly project:

    dotnet new blazorwasm -o MyBlazorApp

        This command tells the .NET SDK to create a new Blazor WebAssembly project in a folder named MyBlazorApp.

    Navigate to the newly created folder and open it in Visual Studio Code.

Exploring the Project Structure

To understand the structure:

    From the top menu, select:
    View → Explorer

    Click Open Folder and select the project folder.

Here's a breakdown of key parts:

    Pages folder:
    Contains .razor files – the main components of your Blazor app, like the homepage or contact page.

    wwwroot folder:
    The public folder for static files (images, CSS, JavaScript). Everything here is accessible to users.

    Program.cs file:
    The entry point for your Blazor app. It configures services and middleware, and runs the application.

Final Setup Steps

To ensure everything works smoothly:

    Install the C# extension in Visual Studio Code:

        Go to the Extensions tab (left-hand side)

        Search for "C#" and install the extension provided by Microsoft

    In the terminal, restore dependencies:

dotnet restore

Verify your .NET SDK installation:

    dotnet --version

    (Optional, in Visual Studio IDE)
    Go to Build → Build Solution from the toolbar to compile the solution.

What’s Next?

🎉 Well done! You've:

    Completed the initial setup of your Blazor project

    Explored the solution structure

    Run your first Blazor app

From here, you can start adding pages, components, and functionality to build a fully interactive web application.

Keep exploring the Blazor framework—there’s so much more you can create!
