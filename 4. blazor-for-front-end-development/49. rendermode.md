Where @rendermode InteractiveServer Is Needed:

Interactive components that require real-time updates (e.g., forms, buttons, dashboards).

Pages that handle user interactions via event handlers (@onclick, @bind, etc.).

Components that rely on server-side logic for processing data dynamically.

Where @rendermode InteractiveServer Is NOT Needed:

Static pages such as login screens, status pages, or documentation pages.

SEO-focused pages where static server-side rendering (SSR) is preferred.

Components that do not require interactivity, such as simple text displays.

Alternative Render Modes
According to Microsoft's Blazor render modes documentation:

Static Server (@rendermode StaticServer): Used for non-interactive pages.

Interactive WebAssembly (@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly): Used for client-side rendering.

Interactive Auto (@rendermode InteractiveAuto): Starts with server-side rendering, then switches to WebAssembly.

Can You Set a Global Render Mode?
Yes, you can set a global render mode (e.g., @rendermode InteractiveServer in Routes.razor) and override it for specific components using StaticServer or other modes (Stack Overflow discussion).

Best Practice
Use @rendermode InteractiveServer only where necessary to optimize performance and scalability.
