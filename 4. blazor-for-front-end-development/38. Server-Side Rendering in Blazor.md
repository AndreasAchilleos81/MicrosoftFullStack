Server-Side Rendering in Blazor

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Explained

## Introduction
Some websites load instantly because they use **server-side rendering (SSR)**. This process generates a **UI** on the server and delivers it fully rendered to the browser, ensuring content is **ready to view** immediately.

## How SSR Works
SSR follows these steps:
1. The **server collects data**.
2. The **HTML content is built**.
3. A **fully rendered page** is sent to the browser.

### Benefits of SSR
- **Enhanced Load Times**: Pages appear instantly.
- **Improved SEO**: Search engines easily index SSR content.
- **Consistent Data Updates**: Ensures the latest content on every request.

## SSR vs. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
Both SSR and **client-side rendering (CSR)** handle UI generation, but differently.

| Rendering Type  | Where UI is Built | Example |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **CSR**       | Browser (Client) | Filtering products in an online store |
| **SSR**       | Server           | News website displaying latest headlines |

### Example: Shopping Website
In CSR:
- A user **applies a filter** to show only products under $50.
- The browser updates the product list **instantly**.

In SSR:
- A **news website** loads with the **latest headlines already displayed**.

## SSR Workflow Example
SSR collects **latest data** and sends a **ready-made page**.

```razor
@page "/products"
<h1>Product Catalog</h1>

@foreach (var product in products)
{
    <div>
        <h2>@product.Name</h2>
        <p>Price: @product.Price</p>
    </div>
}
In the above Blazor snippet:

The server fetches product details.

The browser receives a pre-rendered page.

Advantages of SSR in Content-Heavy Applications
Ensures fresh content: Each request retrieves the latest information.

Optimized for speed: No extra loading for images or product descriptions.

Supports sessions & cookies: User-specific data remains persistent across requests.

razor
@if (isLoggedIn)
{
    <p>Welcome back, @userName!</p>
}
else
{
    <p>Please log in.</p>
}
Example: Searching for a Product
User searches for "shoes".

The server retrieves inventory data.

The browser receives updated product listings.

SSR & Client-Side Interactions
Once a page is loaded, the browser handles actions like sorting or filtering.

razor
<button @onclick="LoadMoreProducts">View More</button>

@code {
    private void LoadMoreProducts() {
        // Fetch additional products from the server
    }
}
Clicking View More fetches additional products without reloading the full page.

Conclusion
Server-side rendering ensures:

Fast load times

Better search engine optimization

Smooth, frustration-free user experience

By preparing pages on the server and supporting real-time updates, SSR delivers consistent, high-performance web applications.
