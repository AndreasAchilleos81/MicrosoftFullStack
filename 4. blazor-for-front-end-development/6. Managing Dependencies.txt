Managing Dependencies in a Blazor Application

Effectively managing dependencies is crucial for keeping your Blazor application secure, performant, and maintainable. Blazor supports a wide range of libraries‚Äîboth from Microsoft and third-party sources‚Äîthat can accelerate development and promote best practices within the community.

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk through how to manage dependencies in a Blazor project using Visual Studio Code and the .NET CLI (Command-Line Interface).
üîç Viewing Installed Dependencies

With your Blazor project open in VS Code, you can check installed dependencies by opening the .csproj file (located in your project‚Äôs root directory). Inside, you'll find the following section:

<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly" Version="7.0.5" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer" Version="7.0.5" />
  <PackageReference Include="System.Net.Http.Json" Version="7.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>

Each <PackageReference> entry specifies a NuGet package and the version installed.
üì¶ Adding a Package via Terminal

The most common way to install a new package is by using the terminal. For example, to install Newtonsoft.Json version 13.0.1, run:

dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 13.0.1

This command:

    Contacts the NuGet catalog

    Downloads the package

    Adds a reference to your .csproj file automatically

After running the command, you‚Äôll see the reference added:

<PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />

‚úçÔ∏è Adding a Package Manually

Alternatively, you can manually edit the .csproj file:

<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>

While IntelliSense helps suggest valid packages and versions, using the terminal or NuGet package manager is more efficient and less error-prone.
üìÑ Listing Installed Packages

To view all installed packages:

dotnet list package

To find outdated packages:

dotnet list package --outdated

You‚Äôll see output like:

> Newtonsoft.Json
  Requested: 13.0.1
  Resolved: 13.0.1
  Latest:    13.0.2

This helps you compare installed versions with the latest available.
‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Package Conflicts

A package conflict happens when one package requires a specific version of another package that conflicts with what's already installed.
Example:

You install:

dotnet add package System.Text.Json --version 6.0.0

Then add:

dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.Json --version 7.0.0

If SignalR.Protocols.Json needs System.Text.Json >= 8.0.0, you‚Äôll get a build error:

Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json 8.0.0 depends on System.Text.Json >= 8.0.0

In this case, you can either:

    Update the conflicting package to the required version

    Remove the incompatible dependency

‚ùå Removing a Package

To remove a package:

dotnet remove package System.Text.Json

This command updates the .csproj file and deletes the reference.
üîÑ Restoring Dependencies

To restore missing packages (e.g., after cloning a repo):

dotnet restore

This checks your .csproj file and installs any missing dependencies.
üõ°Ô∏è Checking for Vulnerabilities

To scan for packages with known security issues:

dotnet list package --vulnerable

Example output:

System.Text.RegularExpressions 3.0.0 has known vulnerabilities.

dotnet add package System.Text.RegularExpressions --version 4.3.1

‚úÖ Summary

In this walkthrough, you learned how to manage dependencies in a Blazor project using VS Code and the .NET CLI:

    View installed packages

    Add packages via terminal or manually

    Identify and resolve version conflicts

    Remove and restore packages

    Check for security vulnerabilities

Effective dependency management is a key part of maintaining a stable, secure Blazor app.
