Imagine a form that adapts and responds to users, capturing information seamlessly and making each interaction feel smooth and intuitive. Forms like these are more than just fields to fill in. They're essential touch points in any application, and in Blazor, we can build them to be both functional and engaging.

In this video, we will describe how to build forms using Blazor components. Let's start by exploring the first Blazor form component, `EditForm`.

The `EditForm` component wraps your form and helps manage user submissions. It links the form to a data model, which is just a way of storing the information from the form. Think of the data model like a container that holds information from the form. In the form, users enter contact information, such as their name and contact preference type. We'll wrap the form in `EditForm` to control how that information is processed when the form is submitted.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create `EditForm` Element**:
   First, create the opening and closing tags for the `EditForm` element. This is the wrapper for the entire form. To connect the form to the data model, add the `Model` attribute to the form.

2. **Define the Data Model**:
   Next, create the contact information object, which is a C# class that holds user data. In this case, set the form to use the `ContactInformation` object, which will be defined later. The `UserDetails` class has two member variables: `Username` and `ContactMethod`, which can be used to set data and retrieve it later.

3. **Handle Form Submission**:
   Use the `OnSubmit` event on the form to instruct Blazor to run the `HandleSubmit` method when the user submits their form data.


<EditForm Model="@user" OnValidSubmit="@HandleValidSubmit">
    <DataAnnotationsValidator />
    <ValidationSummary />
    
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <InputText id="name" @bind-Value="user.Name" />
    <ValidationMessage For="@(() => user.Name)" />
    
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</EditForm>

@code {
    private User user = new User();

    private void HandleValidSubmit()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {user.Name}");
    }

    public class User
    {
        [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required.")]
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}

Example with Dropdown and Validation:

<EditForm Model="@contactInfo" OnValidSubmit="@HandleSubmit">
    <DataAnnotationsValidator />
    <ValidationSummary />

    <label for="contactMethod">Contact Method:</label>
    <InputSelect id="contactMethod" @bind-Value="contactInfo.ContactMethod">
        <option value="">--Select--</option>
        <option value="Email">Email</option>
        <option value="Phone">Phone</option>
    </InputSelect>
    <ValidationMessage For="@(() => contactInfo.ContactMethod)" />

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</EditForm>

@code {
    private ContactInfo contactInfo = new ContactInfo();

    private void HandleSubmit()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Contact Method: {contactInfo.ContactMethod}");
    }

    public class ContactInfo
    {
        [Required(ErrorMessage = "Contact method is required.")]
        public string ContactMethod { get; set; }
        public string ContactMethod { get; set; }
    }
}

### Capturing Text Input:

To capture the user's name:
- Use the `InputText` component to get text input.
- Wrap the `InputText` element inside a `div` element with a `label` that describes the field.
- Bind the `InputText` element to the `Username` variable in the `UserDetails` object using the `@bind-Value` directive. 

This allows the user's input to automatically update the `Username` variable in the data model.

### Adding a Dropdown for Contact Method:

To offer users a dropdown list for contact method:
- Use the `InputSelect` component.
- Wrap the `InputSelect` element inside a `div` with a `label` describing the dropdown field.
- Define two child `option` elements for the available choices (e.g., `Email` and `Phone`).
- Bind the `InputSelect` value to the `ContactMethod` property in the `UserDetails` object.

### Adding a Submit Button:

Add a button to the form that triggers the `HandleSubmit` method defined in the `OnSubmit` event of the `EditForm` component.

### Handling Form Submission in C#:

Use the `@code` directive to define what happens when the form is submitted. For example:
- Initialize the `UserDetails` object and assign it to the `ContactInformation` variable.
- Write the `HandleSubmit` method with a `void` return type.
- Access the form data using the `ContactInformation` object and write its values to the console.

By leveraging Blazor's data binding, the form automatically updates the `UserDetails` object when users provide input or make selections.

@page "/form-example"
@inject ILogger<FormExample> Logger

<form method="post" @onsubmit="Submit">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <InputText id="name" @bind-Value="Model.Name" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

@code {
    [SupplyParameterFromForm]
    private UserModel? Model { get; set; }

    private void Submit()
    {
        Logger.LogInformation($"Name: {Model?.Name}");
    }

    public class UserModel
    {
        public string? Name { get; set; }
    }
}

Creating forms in Blazor allows you to easily collect and manage data. With components like `EditForm`, `InputText`, and `InputSelect`, you can build engaging and functional forms that handle submissions seamlessly.
