# Sorting Algorithms in .NET Core

When attempting to arrange data in a set, whether it's an array or other types of sets of data, you can use a variety of different algorithms. There's **Quick Sort** or **Merge Sort**.  

In this case, we're going to look at **Bubble Sort**, which is a very specific way of arranging data. Each of the types of algorithms mentioned have different **time** and **space complexities** associated with them.  

We will focus on Bubble Sort and compare it with Merge Sort and Quick Sort in terms of **time complexity**. This demonstration will be implemented in a **.NET Core console application**.

---

## Bubble Sort Implementation

We start with a simple console app containing three different methods: `BubbleSort`, `QuickSort`, and `MergeSort`. For demonstration, we’ll focus on Bubble Sort.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1, 6 };

        // Clone array for comparison
        int[] bubbleArray = (int[])numbers.Clone();
        int[] quickArray = (int[])numbers.Clone();
        int[] mergeArray = (int[])numbers.Clone();

        Console.WriteLine("Original Array: " + string.Join(", ", numbers));

        BubbleSort(bubbleArray);
        Console.WriteLine("Bubble Sorted: " + string.Join(", ", bubbleArray));

        Array.Sort(quickArray); // QuickSort (built-in)
        Console.WriteLine("Quick Sorted: " + string.Join(", ", quickArray));

        Array.Sort(mergeArray); // MergeSort (built-in)
        Console.WriteLine("Merge Sorted: " + string.Join(", ", mergeArray));
    }

    static void BubbleSort(int[] arr)
    {
        int n = arr.Length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
            {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
                {
                    // Swap
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Space Complexity

- Bubble Sort does **not** create a copy of the array internally.  
- It simply rearranges elements within the array.  
- Space complexity is **O(1)** (constant space).

---

## Time Complexity

Bubble Sort requires nested loops:

- Worst case: **O(n²)**  
- Best case (already sorted): **O(n)**  
- Average case: **O(n²)**  

Quick Sort and Merge Sort are much faster for large datasets:

- Quick Sort: **O(n log n)** average  
- Merge Sort: **O(n log n)** worst case  

---

## Debugging Bubble Sort

When debugging, you can place a breakpoint inside the `if` statement to watch how elements move around in the array.

Example watch during execution:

```
Initial: 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1, 6
Step 1: 3, 5, 4, 2, 7, 1, 6, 8
Step 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7, 8
Final: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
```

---

## Performance Comparison

When running with small arrays (e.g., 8 elements):

```
Bubble Sort: 0 ms
Quick Sort: 0 ms
Merge Sort: 0 ms
```

With larger arrays (10,000 elements):

```
Bubble Sort: 127 ms
Quick Sort: 1 ms
Merge Sort: 1 ms
```

With very large arrays (50,000 elements):

```
Bubble Sort: ~4000 ms
Quick Sort: 5 ms
Merge Sort: 8 ms
```

---

## Conclusion

- **Bubble Sort** is excellent for **small datasets**.  
- It uses minimal memory but suffers from poor time complexity as data size grows.  
- **Quick Sort** and **Merge Sort** are far more efficient for large datasets.  

⚠️ Use Bubble Sort only in **specific circumstances** where simplicity matters more than performance.

Would you like me to also **add a stopwatch-based benchmarking example in C#** so you can measure the execution times of Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort directly in your console app?

# Quicksort vs Merge Sort in .NET Core

When working with sets of data, you can organize it using **Quicksort** or **Merge Sort**, but each has a different **space** and **time complexity**.  

In this screencast, we're going to implement Quicksort and Merge Sort algorithms in **.NET Core** and analyze their performance.

---

## Initial Setup

We start with a simple console app. The array contains numbers 1 through 8 for the first example.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] numbers = { 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1, 6 };

        int[] quickArray = (int[])numbers.Clone();
        int[] mergeArray = (int[])numbers.Clone();

        Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();

        // Run QuickSort
        sw.Start();
        QuickSort(quickArray, 0, quickArray.Length - 1);
        sw.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine($"QuickSort Time: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

        // Run MergeSort
        sw.Restart();
        MergeSort(mergeArray, 0, mergeArray.Length - 1);
        sw.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine($"MergeSort Time: {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

        Console.WriteLine("QuickSort Result: " + string.Join(", ", quickArray));
        Console.WriteLine("MergeSort Result: " + string.Join(", ", mergeArray));
    }
```

---

## Quicksort Implementation

Quicksort works recursively by partitioning the array and rearranging elements.

```csharp
static void QuickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        int pi = Partition(arr, low, high);

        QuickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        QuickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

static int Partition(int[] arr, int low, int high)
{
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = (low - 1);

    for (int j = low; j < high; j++)
    {
        if (arr[j] < pivot)
        {
            i++;
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }

    int temp1 = arr[i + 1];
    arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
    arr[high] = temp1;

    return i + 1;
}
```

---

## Merge Sort Implementation

Merge Sort recursively divides the array into halves and merges them back in sorted order.

```csharp
static void MergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right)
{
    if (left < right)
    {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;

        MergeSort(arr, left, mid);
        MergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

        Merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

static void Merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right)
{
    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    int[] L = new int[n1];
    int[] R = new int[n2];

    Array.Copy(arr, left, L, 0, n1);
    Array.Copy(arr, mid + 1, R, 0, n2);

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;

    while (i < n1 && j < n2)
    {
        if (L[i] <= R[j])
        {
            arr[k++] = L[i++];
        }
        else
        {
            arr[k++] = R[j++];
        }
    }

    while (i < n1)
    {
        arr[k++] = L[i++];
    }

    while (j < n2)
    {
        arr[k++] = R[j++];
    }
}
```

## Performance Analysis

### Small Array (8 elements)
- **QuickSort:** 0 ms  
- **MergeSort:** 0 ms  

Both algorithms run instantly because the dataset is too small.

### Larger Array (100,000 elements)
- **QuickSort:** ~13 ms  
- **MergeSort:** ~16 ms  

### Very Large Array (1,000,000 elements)
- **QuickSort:** ~132 ms  
- **MergeSort:** ~182 ms

## Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm   | Time Complexity (Average) | Space Complexity |
|-------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Quicksort   | O(n log n)                 | O(log n)         |
| Merge Sort  | O(n log n)                 | O(n)             |

---

## Conclusion

- **Quicksort** is generally faster and uses less memory.  
- **Merge Sort** is more predictable (guaranteed O(n log n)) but requires extra space.  
- For small arrays, both are equally efficient.  
- For large arrays, Quicksort tends to be faster, while Merge Sort consumes more memory.
```

Would you like me to also **add a benchmarking example with random arrays** (e.g., 10,000 / 100,000 / 1,000,000 elements) so you can directly measure the performance differences in your console app?
